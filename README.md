# Docker-Upload
This project intends to provide an easy way to allow people to upload files to you via a web interface, secured with an access code in order to prevent bad actors from discovering your web service and filling up your drives.

## Progress
This project is not yet complete. Here's a list of the things that still need work:
- Password input/checking
- Creation of docker image
